"""Interactive admin console for the part3 in-memory product store.

Running this module starts a read-eval-print loop over a single product
store that lives in memory for the lifetime of the process. Every line
typed at the prompt is stripped of surrounding whitespace and matched
against the set of known commands:

* ``help`` -- print the list of commands and what each one does;
* ``exit`` -- leave the loop and end the program;
* ``show`` -- print the whole store as a text table;
* ``create <name...> <price> <quantity>`` -- add a product;
* ``read <id>`` -- print one product;
* ``update <id> <name...> <price> <quantity>`` -- overwrite a product;
* ``delete <id>`` -- remove a product.

For ``create`` and ``update`` the price and quantity are always the last
two words of the line; everything between the verb (and, for ``update``,
the id) and those two words is joined with single spaces into the
product name, so a multi-word name such as ``Gibson SG Junior`` needs no
quoting.

The four CRUD commands forward to :mod:`src.part3.crud`; whatever
that call returns is printed unless it is ``None``. A line whose first
word is not a known verb, or that carries the wrong number of arguments
for its verb, prints an "is not a command" notice. A line that names a
command correctly but whose id, price or quantity argument will not
parse prints a distinct "arguments are invalid" notice. Either way the
store is left untouched and the loop keeps running; only ``exit`` stops
it.
